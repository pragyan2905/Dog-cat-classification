# üê∂ Dog vs. Cat Image Classification üê±

This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## üìù Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats. This is a classic computer vision problem that serves as a great introduction to building CNNs. The notebook covers all the essential steps, from data preparation and model creation to training and evaluation.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle. It contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats, split into training and testing sets.

* **Training set:** 20,000 images
* **Testing set:** 5,000 images

You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats).

## üß† Model Architecture

The CNN model is built sequentially and consists of the following layers:

1.  **Conv2D Layer:** 32 filters, kernel size of (3,3), ReLU activation. This layer is responsible for extracting features from the input images.
2.  **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes the activations of the previous layer to improve training speed and stability.
3.  **MaxPooling2D:** Downsamples the feature maps, reducing the spatial dimensions and computational complexity.
4.  **Conv2D Layer:** 64 filters, kernel size of (3,3), ReLU activation.
5.  **Batch Normalization:**
6.  **MaxPooling2D:**
7.  **Conv2D Layer:** 128 filters, kernel size of (3,3), ReLU activation.
8.  **Batch Normalization:**
9.  **MaxPooling2D:**
10. **Flatten:** Flattens the 3D output from the convolutional layers into a 1D vector.
11. **Dense Layer:** A fully connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
12. **Dense Layer:** A fully connected layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation.
13. **Dropout Layer:** A dropout layer with a rate of 0.1 to prevent overfitting.
14. **Dense Layer (Output):** A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output a probability between 0 and 1 (0 for cat, 1 for dog).

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

2.  **Installation:**
    Install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
    ```

3.  **Set up Kaggle API:**
    * Create a Kaggle account and download your `kaggle.json` API token.
    * Upload the `kaggle.json` file to your environment.

4.  **Download Dataset:**
    Run the notebook cells that download and extract the dataset from Kaggle.

5.  **Train the Model:**
    Execute the cells to define, compile, and train the CNN model on the training data.

6.  **Evaluate and Predict:**
    * The notebook includes code to visualize the training/validation accuracy and loss.
    * You can use the trained model to predict on new images of dogs and cats.

## üìä Results

The model was trained for 15 epochs and achieved high accuracy on the training set and good performance on the validation set.

* **Training Accuracy:** The model reaches over 99% accuracy on the training data.
* **Validation Accuracy:** The validation accuracy fluctuates but generally stays around 80-85%, indicating some overfitting.

The training and validation accuracy/loss are plotted to visualize the model's performance over time.
